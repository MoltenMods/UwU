## Hall Of Fame ðŸŽ‰

- UwU conversion based on https://owoifier--black-is-back.repl.co.
- Inspired by the Twitter posts from
  [Sanae](https://twitter.com/AmongUsGame/status/1388217661658603524?s=20)
  and
  [Roobscoob](https://twitter.com/roobscoob1/status/1388011904900157441?s=20).
  The idea was originally theirs and I ~~stole~~ decided to take
  ~~their work~~ inspiration.
